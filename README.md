# Simple File-Based Relational-Like Database

## Overview
This project implements a simple file-based database that simulates relational database functionality.

The database supports basic operations such as inserting, updating, selecting, and deleting rows within tables.

## Features
- **Table Management**: Create and drop tables dynamically.
- **Data Persistence**: Save tables to disk in text files, ensuring data is retained across application runs.
- **Basic SQL-like Operations**: 
  - Insert rows into tables.
  - Update existing rows.
  - Delete rows from tables.
  - Select and display rows from tables.
