In this project Weâ€™re creating a simple database project, starting simple with a Key-Value store and eventually extending it to SQL-like functionality.
The projects will be implementd through 4 stages:
  1- Lab 1: Defining the interfaces and implemente a basic version of a Key-Value Database (IDataBase).
  2- Lab 2: Begin the implementation of the interfaces, creating a locally working database that persists data.
The next two stages will be clarified and implemented later :)
