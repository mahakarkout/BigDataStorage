# Simple File-Based Relational-Like Database

## Overview
This project implements a database that simulates relational database functionality. It allows for the creation, management, and persistence of tables using a flat file storage system. Till now, The database supports basic operations such as inserting, updating, selecting, and deleting rows within tables.

## Features
- **Table Management**: Create and drop tables dynamically.
- **Data Persistence**: Save tables to disk in text files, ensuring data is retained across application runs.
- **Basic SQL-like Operations**: 
  - Insert rows into tables.
  - Update existing rows.
  - Delete rows from tables.
  - Select and display rows from tables.
  

## The project goes through 4 stages, this Implementation represent only the first two stages:
    lab 1: interfaces for your db, Interfaces for classes, this is how we define the skeleton of our program. 
    lab 2: implementation of interfaces. At this stage we should get a locally working db.

Here are the current outputs for these stages:
      1- Testing creating table and inserst rows
